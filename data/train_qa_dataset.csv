How do you treat sudden cardiac death (SCD)?,"Sudden cardiac arrest can be treated if addressed within the first few minutes. The American Heart Association promotes the following four steps, called ""the chain of survival:"" Early Access to Care. Quick contact with emergency care is essential. Call 911 (in most communities) or your local emergency number immediately. Early Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR). Learning CPR is the greatest gift you can give your family and friends. If performed properly (see below), CPR can help save a life until emergency medical help arrives. Early Defibrillation. In most adults, sudden cardiac death is related to ventricular fibrillation. Quick defibrillation (delivery of an electrical shock) is necessary to return the heart rhythm to a normal heartbeat. Many public places, such as malls, golf courses, and airports, have automated external defibrillators ( AEDs; see below) available for use in emergency situations. Early Advanced Care. After successful defibrillation, most patients require hospital care to treat and prevent future events. These four steps can increase survival as much as 90% if initiated within the first minutes after sudden cardiac arrest. Survival decreases by about 10% each minute longer.","Early Access to Care, CPR, Defibrillation, Advanced Care",10,"Perfect answer, includes all four steps of the chain of survival","Call 911, CPR, Defibrillation, Hospital Care",8,"Good attempt, missing a mention of the importance of quick action and AEDs"

Will my dog need surgery for a sprain or a strain?,"Surgery is in order for otherwise-healthy dogs that don’t get better, keep injuring themselves, or have a torn tendon or ligament.","Yes, surgery may be necessary for torn tendons.",8,Good job focusing on the need for surgery.,Surgery is not usually needed for sprains.,5,Mention both sprains and strains for a complete answer.
Can dogs get sprains or strains?,"The words sound alike, but they mean different things. Strains injure tendons that link muscles and bones. This can happen if your dog stretches too far, too much, or too often. Athletic dogs get strains, but this injury also can happen when a dog slips, falls, or jumps during normal play. In dogs, strains are common in the hips and thighs. Sprains harm the ligaments that connect bones, which causes joint damage. Sprains can happen to hunting dogs who jump hurdles, as well as to the average dog who may hurt himself taking a hard landing off the couch, or even by something as simple as stepping in a hole. The wrist and knee are common joints for dogs to sprain. One of the most serious injuries is a torn cranial cruciate ligament ( CCL), which connects the bones of the knee.",Sprains are commonly found in the wrist and knee.,10,Correct and concise answer.,Sprains are commonly found in the tail and ears.,3,"Incorrect, sprains occur in the wrist and knee, not tail or ears."
How do you know your dog has a strain or sprain?,"The first warning sign of strains or sprains may be that your dog starts to limp or is suddenly lame, meaning he can’t use his leg.

How will the vet diagnose my pet with a sprain or strain?,"Imagine doing that all day and you’ll have a better idea of the weight and stress your dog puts on his muscles and joints. She’ll want to see him walk, sit, and lie down. She may take X-rays or do an MRI or ultrasound to get a look at damage that can’t be seen from the outside. X-rays show problems with bones. The other kinds of images are better for seeing tissue damage.","The vet may perform X-rays, MRI, or ultrasound.",10,Correct and comprehensive answer.,The vet will look at how your pet moves.,5,"Partial answer, missing details about imaging tests."
How do you treat a dog's sprain or  strain?,"In a typical plan to treat strains and sprains, your vet may tell you to: Give your dog nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) to ease inflammation. Apply an ice pack or heating pad. Make sure your dog rests. Walk your dog on a leash, taking it slowly at first. Use a brace or support to hold your dog’s muscle or joint in place. Try physical therapy, such as walk on an underwater or land treadmill, balancing on a ball or board. Massage the area. Put your dog on a diet.","Give NSAIDs, apply ice pack, rest, brace.",10,Correct and comprehensive answer.,"Give NSAIDs, apply hot pack, no rest.",5,Incorrect use of hot pack instead of ice pack.
What is the stomach flu?,"These viruses target the digestive tract and cause inflammation of the stomach and intestines. The most awful symptoms -- diarrhea, vomiting, and cramps -- are actually your body's defense mechanisms. Your body is trying to drive the virus out. Stomach flu can develop at any time of the year, but it's most common in the fall and winter in the U. S. Although unpleasant, stomach flu is rarely serious. Symptoms usually last for 1 to 3 days and sometimes longer. The greatest risk -- especially in babies and older people -- comes from dehydration. Untreated, dehydration can be dangerous. Despite the name, stomach flu has nothing to do with the ""true"" flu, influenza. Influenza causes body ache and fever. It almost never causes diarrhea or vomiting in adults. Rarely, it can trigger vomiting in children. There is no cure for the stomach flu. Antibiotics don't help, because it's caused by viruses, not bacteria.",Viruses causing inflammation of stomach and intestines.,10,"Perfect answer, well done!","Virus causing stomach and intestine inflammation, leading to symptoms.",8,"Good attempt, could be more specific about symptoms."
How do you treat stomach flu?,"There is no cure for the stomach flu. Antibiotics don't help, because it's caused by viruses, not bacteria. For the most part, you just have to wait it out. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to make yourself more comfortable and prevent complications. Drink more. It's important to increase fluid intake when you are vomiting or have diarrhea. Adults should aim to get one cup of fluid every hour. Children need 1 ounce of fluid every 30 to 60 minutes. Drink slowly, since too much at once could worsen vomiting. If your child tends to gulp, give her a frozen popsicle instead. Drink wisely. When you have diarrhea, drinking more water may not be enough. You're losing important minerals and electrolytes that water can't supply. Instead, ask your doctor about giving your sick child an oral rehydration solution such as Cera Lyte, Infalyte, Naturalyte, Pedialyte, and generic brands. ( If your baby is still nursing or using formula, keep feeding him as usual.) Adults can use oral rehydration solutions or diluted juices, diluted sports drinks, clear broth, or decaffeinated tea. Sugary, carbonated, caffeinated, or alcoholic drinks can make diarrhea worse, so be sure to dilute sugary beverages if you drink them. Don't eat only bland foods. The old advice was to stick with a liquid diet for a few days and then to add in bland foods, such as the BRAT diet of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. That's fine for the first day or so of stomach flu. However, doctors say that you should return to your normal diet as soon as you feel up to it. BRAT foods aren't bad. They just don't provide the fat and protein that you need. Sticking with them too long could actually slow your recovery. Get the right nutrients. Look for foods with potassium (such as potatoes, bananas, and fruit juices), salt (such as pretzels and soup), and yogurt with active bacterial cultures. Even a little fat could help, because it slows down digestion and may reduce diarrhea. If you feel up to it, add a pat of butter or some lean meat to your next meal. Use over-the-counter medications. They're not necessary, but some people find relief in medications for diarrhea and vomiting. Just use them with care, and read and follow the label instructions. Never give a medication for diarrhea or vomiting to a child unless a pediatrician says that you should. Rest. Give your body time to recover.","Increase fluid intake, use oral rehydration solutions, rest.",9,"Good comprehensive answer covering hydration, nutrition, and rest.","Drink water, eat bland foods, take over-the-counter medications.",5,Partial answer missing important details like oral rehydration solutions and rest.

Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, before eating, and after changing a diaper. Use hand sanitizer. If you're not near a sink to wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Be aware that hand sanitizer may not be as effective as hand washing at preventing the stomach flu. Wipe down surfaces. If a family member has the stomach flu, wash off high-traffic areas -- such as the bathroom, door knobs, phones, and TV remotes -- with a diluted bleach solution. If it's possible, keep healthy people out of the bathroom the sick person is using. Make sure your kids get their vaccines. Vaccines for rotavirus can protect children from some types of stomach flu. Kids usually get the vaccines before they are age 2.","Wash hands thoroughly, use sanitizer, clean surfaces.",10,Great job!

Newborns should nurse 8-12 times a day for the first month; when your child gets to be 4 to 8 weeks old, he'll probably start nursing 7-9 times a day. If he's drinking formula, your baby will probably want a bottle every 2 to 3 hours at first. As your child grows, he should be able to go 3 to 4 hours without eating. You may notice that your baby sometimes wants to eat more often or a larger amount than normal. This usually happens when a child is growing rapidly.

However, several factors may influence hair loss: Hormones, such as abnormal levels of androgens (male hormones normally produced by both men and women) Genes, from both male and female parents, may influence a person's predisposition to male or female pattern baldness. Stress, illness, and childbirthcan cause temporary hair loss. Ringworm caused by a fungal infection can also cause hair loss. Drugs, including chemotherapy drugs used in cancer treatment, blood thinners, beta-adrenergic blockers used to control blood pressure, and birth control pills, can cause temporary hair loss. Burns, injuries, and X-rays can cause temporary hair loss. In such cases, normal hair growth usually returns once the injury heals unless a scar is produced. Then, hair will never regrow. Autoimmune disease may cause alopecia areata. In alopecia areata, the immune system revs up for unknown reasons and affects the hair follicles. In most people with alopecia areata, the hair grows back, although it may temporarily be very fine and possibly a lighter color before normal coloration and thickness return. Cosmetic procedures, such as shampooing too often, perms, bleaching, and dyeing hair can contribute to overall hair thinning by making hair weak and brittle. Tight braiding, using rollers or hot curlers, and running hair picks through tight curls can also damage and break hair. However, these procedures don't cause baldness. In most instances hair grows back normally if the source of the problem is removed. Still, severe damage to the hair or scalp sometimes causes permanent bald patches. Medical conditions. Thyroid disease, lupus, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, eating disorders, and anemia can cause hair loss. Most times, when the underlying condition is treated, the hair will return unless there is scarring as in some forms of lupus, lichen planus or follicular disorders. Diet. A low-protein diet or severely calorie-restricted diet can also cause temporary hair loss.","Hormones, genetics, stress, illness, medications, autoimmune diseases.",10,"Well done, comprehensive answer covering various causes of hair loss.","Genetics, stress, medications, diet, medical conditions, cosmetic procedures.",8,"Good effort, but could have included more specific details about each cause."

Avoiding: The person may avoid people, places, thoughts, or situations that may remind him or her of the trauma. This can lead to feelings of detachment and isolation from family and friends, as well as a loss of interest in activities that the person once enjoyed. Increased arousal: These include excessive emotions; problems relating to others, including feeling or showing affection; difficulty falling or staying asleep; irritability; outbursts of anger; difficulty concentrating; and being ""jumpy"" or easily startled. The person may also suffer physical symptoms, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, rapid breathing, muscle tension, nausea, and diarrhea.

What causes apraxia of speech?,"It is often accompanied by other language or cognitive deficits, which may cause: Limited vocabulary Grammatical problems Problems with coordination and fine motor skills Difficulties chewing and swallowing Clumsiness Acquired apraxia results from brain damage to those areas of the brain that control the ability to speak. Conditions that may produce acquired apraxia include head trauma, stroke, or a brain tumor. Experts do not yet understand what causes childhood apraxia of speech. Some scientists believe that it results from signaling problems between the brain and the muscles used for speaking. Ongoing research is focusing on whether brain abnormalities that cause apraxia of speech can be identified. Other research is looking for genetic causes of apraxia. Some studies are trying to determine exactly which parts of the brain are linked to the condition.",Brain damage to areas controlling speech.,9,"Clear and concise, good explanation.",It is often accompanied by other deficits.,5,"Vague answer, could be more specific and detailed."
Are there different types of apraxia of speech?,"There are two forms of apraxia of speech -- acquired apraxia and childhood apraxia of speech. Acquired apraxia can occur in people of all ages. Typically, though, it is found in adults. This condition causes people to lose the speech-making abilities they once possessed. Childhood apraxia of speech is a motor speech disorder. This condition is present from birth, and it affects a child's ability to form sounds and words. Children with speech apraxia often have far greater abilities to understand speech than to express themselves with spoken words.","Yes, there are two types - acquired apraxia and childhood apraxia.",10,Correct and concise answer.,There is only one type of apraxia of speech.,2,"Partially correct, missed mentioning the two types."
Are there tests to diagnose apraxia of speech?,"There is not a single test or procedure that is used to diagnose childhood apraxia of speech. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that speech-language pathologists have different opinions about which symptoms indicate the condition. Most experts, though, look for the presence of multiple, common apraxia symptoms. They may assess a patient's ability to repeat a word multiple times. Or they may assess whether a person can recite a list of words that are increasingly more difficult, such as ""play, playful, playfully."" A speech-language pathologist may interact with a child to assess which sounds, syllables, and words the child is able to make and understand.

It's frequently caused by damage to tissue such as bone, muscle, or organs, and the onset is often accompanied by anxiety or emotional distress. Chronic pain lasts longer than acute pain and is generally somewhat resistant to medical treatment. It's usually associated with a long-term illness, such as osteoarthritis. In some cases, such as with fibromyalgia, it's one of the defining characteristic of the disease. Chronic pain can be the result of damaged tissue, but very often is attributable to nerve damage. Both acute and chronic pain can be debilitating, and both can affect and be affected by a person's state of mind. But the nature of chronic pain -- the fact that it's ongoing and in some cases seems almost constant -- makes the person who has it more susceptible to psychological consequences such as depression and anxiety. At the same time, psychological distress can amplify the pain. About 70% of people with chronic pain treated with pain medication experience episodes of what's called breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain refers to flares of pain that occur even when pain medication is being used regularly. Sometimes it can be spontaneous or set off by a seemingly insignificant event such as rolling over in bed.

What are some myths about electrolysis?,"Myth: Electrolysis is very painful. For most people, today's methods don't cause a lot of pain, but it can hurt.

Chemical depilatories (liquids or creams) are often used to remove body hair. These products contain irritating chemicals and can be time-consuming and messy. Likewise, bleaches contain harsh chemicals and do little to disguise dark hair. They may also discolor skin. Waxing is another temporary method of hair removal and is usually done in salons. A hot wax is applied to the skin and removed once it has dried over the hair. The hair is stripped off when the wax is removed. Waxing can be painful and costly. Home waxing kits are available, but they can be messy and difficult to use.

Many states require electrologists to be licensed or certified within the state to practice. If you live in one of those states, be sure the practitioner's certificate is current and on display. For states that do not regulate electrolysis, look for electrologists who have certification from an accredited electrology school. Ask around. One of the best ways to find good services is to ask friends and family as well as your doctor for recommendations. If you know anybody who has undergone electrolysis, ask for his or her input. Get a consultation. Many places will give you a free consultation. During the consultation, be sure all of your questions are answered. Some things you may want to ask about include: how the procedure will feel; how many visits you will likely need; how much each visit costs; how long each session lasts; how long the practitioner has been in business; and the number of clients he or she has treated. Make sure the electrologist uses the right technique. The practitioner should use needle electrolysis, which is the only permanent form of hair removal. Some places may advertise electrolysis but use electronic tweezers or photoepilators instead. These are not permanent hair removal procedures. Use common sense. When you go to your consultation, look around. Does the place look clean? Do the workers look clean? Do they use disposable gloves or needles? Ask to meet the person who will be performing the electrolysis. Does he or she strike you as professional? If you are not comfortable with somebody, look for someone else to do the procedure. Personal comfort is essential to knowing you have made the right choice.",Look for licensed or certified electrologists in your state.,9,Good job summarizing the key point about qualifications.,Ask around for recommendations from friends and family.,7,"Good suggestion, but could be more specific about asking for certification or licensing status."

Your doctor can see these when examining the eyes. Your doctor may also ask you to look at an Amsler grid -- a pattern of straight lines that resemble a checkerboard. Some of the straight lines may appear wavy to you, or you may notice that some of the lines are missing.

What happens after age-related macular degeneration is detected?,"If your doctor detects age-related macular degeneration, you may have a procedure called angiography or an OCT. In angiography, a dye is injected into a vein in the arm. Photographs are taken as the dye reaches the eye and flows through the blood vessels of the retina. If there are new vessels or vessels leaking fluid or blood in the macula, the photographs will show their exact location and type. OCT is able to see fluid or blood underneath the retina without using dye. Early detection of age-related macular degeneration is very important because there are treatments that can delay or reduce the severity of the disease.",Procedures like angiography or OCT are conducted for further evaluation.,10,Correct and concise answer.,The doctor will do some tests to check the eyes.,3,"Partial answer, lacking details about specific procedures like angiography or OCT."

How does hormonal contraception work?,"A woman becomes pregnant when an egg released from her ovary (the organ that holds her eggs) is fertilized by a man's sperm. The fertilized egg attaches to the inside of a woman's womb (uterus), where it receives nourishment and develops into a baby. Hormones in the woman's body control the release of the egg from the ovary -- called ovulation -- and prepare the body to accept the fertilized egg. Hormonal contraceptives (the pill, the patch, and the vaginal ring) all contain a small amount of man-made estrogen and progestin hormones. These hormones work to inhibit the body's natural cyclical hormones to prevent pregnancy. Pregnancy is prevented by a combination of factors. The hormonal contraceptive usually stops the body from ovulating. Hormonal contraceptives also change the cervical mucus to make it difficult for the sperm to go through the cervix and find an egg. Hormonal contraceptives can also prevent pregnancy by changing the lining of the womb so it's unlikely the fertilized egg will be implanted.",Hormonal contraceptives inhibit ovulation and change cervical mucus.,10,Excellent explanation covering key points.,Hormonal contraceptives prevent pregnancy by regulating hormone levels.,8,"Good, but could be more specific on mechanisms of action."

About a quarter of all coronary arteries treated with bare-metal stents would close up again, usually in about 6 months. So doctors and companies began testing stents coated with drugs that interrupted the re-narrowing. These are called drug-eluting stents. In clinical trials, these reduced re-narrowing cases to less than 10%. They also lowered the need for repeat procedures for people with diabetes, who have a bigger chance of their arteries getting narrow again.",Bare metal stents and drug-eluting stents.,10,Correct and concise answer.,Metal stents and drug-coated stents.,7,"Close, but could be more specific about the types."
Do drug-eluting stents have complications?,"Still, there were concerns that drug-eluting stents were associated with a rare but serious complication called in-stent thrombosis. This is where a blood clot forms in a stent one or more years after it's implanted. Because this complication can be fatal, it's important that people with drug-eluting stents take aspirin and an anticlotting drug as prescribed until a doctor tells them to stop.","Yes, in-stent thrombosis is a rare complication.",10,Correct and concise answer.,Drug-eluting stents can cause blood clots.,6,"Partially correct, missing specific complication mentioned in the context."
How are stents used in the balloon angioplasty?,"The stent expands when the balloon is inflated, locks into place, and forms a permanent scaffold to hold the artery open after the balloon is deflated and removed.

Destruction of more tooth structure -- healthy parts of the tooth must often be removed to make a space large enough to hold the amalgam filling. Discoloration -- amalgam fillings can create a grayish hue to the surrounding tooth structure. Cracks and fractures -- although all teeth expand and contract in the presence of hot and cold liquids, which ultimately can cause the tooth to crack or fracture, amalgam material -- in comparison with other filling materials -- may experience a wider degree of expansion and contraction and lead to a higher incidence of cracks and fractures. Allergic reactions -- a small percentage of people, approximately 1%, are allergic to the mercury present in amalgam restorations.","Poor aesthetics, destruction of tooth structure, discoloration, cracks, allergic reactions.",10,"Excellent response, covers all major disadvantages of silver fillings.","Poor color match, removal of healthy tooth, metal discoloration, risk of fractures.",8,"Good attempt, could have included more details on allergic reactions for a higher score."
What steps are involved in filling a tooth?,"First, the dentist will use a local anesthetic to numb the area around the tooth to be filled. Next, a drill, air abrasion instrument, or laser will be used to remove the decayed area.

How can you avoid food allergies when feeding a baby?,"It's most important to introduce a baby to new foods gradually, one at a time, in case of food allergies. If not, a parent may have trouble tying an allergy to a specific new food. For example, if you give your baby three new foods over the course of a day and she develops an allergic reaction, you won't know which of the foods provoked it. The type of food or the order in which food is introduced is not much of a concern, as long as the foods you are offering are healthy and well-balanced for the baby. Each time you offer a new food, you should wait three to five days before adding another new item to the menu. Don't eliminate the other foods your baby is eating during that time; you already know these are safe because the child has not had any food reactions up until now. Just don't add anything else new.","Introduce new foods gradually, one at a time.",10,"Perfect answer, concise and accurate.",Feed baby all new foods at once.,2,"Incorrect, introducing multiple new foods at once can lead to confusion in identifying allergens."
How can you protect your baby from food allergies?,"In a reversal of earlier policy, the American Academy of Pediatrics is now recommending that potential allergens be introduced to your infant earlier rather than later. In doing so, the move may actually help prevent her from developing allergies to those foods. Breastfeeding you baby for 4-6 months is the best way to prevent a milk allergy. Remember that breast milk or formula is higher in nutrition. When you begin to introducing whole milk, you should do so under a doctor's supervision. Yogurt and soft cheeses are fine, because the proteins in these dairy products are broken down and less likely to cause tummy trouble. The AAP now advises that, in the case of infants who are at high risk of allergies, peanuts should be introduced between 4-6 months. Infants at highest risk of developing peanut allergies are those with eczema or egg allergies or both. It was originally believed that introducing your baby to the foods when she is older might make any reactions more manageable. Other potential allergens such as tree nuts and fish should be introduced over a period of time as you introduce your baby to solid foods, between 6 and 9 months You should wait until at least age 1 (some experts say age 2) to introduce honey, which can cause a potentially serious disease called infant botulism. Ask your pediatrician for guidance.","Introduce potential allergens early, breastfeed for 4-6 months.",10,Correct and comprehensive answer covering early introduction and breastfeeding.,"Breastfeeding and introducing allergens early, like peanuts at 4-6 months.",9,"Good answer, but could have mentioned specific allergens and high-risk infants."

When is a combination implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker therapy recommended to treat heart failure?,"People with heart failure who have poor ejection fractions (measurement that shows how well the heart pumps with each beat) are at risk for fast irregular heart rhythms -- some of which can be life-threatening -- called arrhythmias. Currently, doctors use an ICD to prevent these dangerous rhythms. The device works by detecting such a rhythm and shocking the heart back to normal. These devices can combine biventricular pacing with anti-tachycardia (fast heart rate) pacing and internal defibrillators ( ICDs) to deliver treatment as needed. Current studies are showing that resynchronization may even lessen the amount of arrhythmia that occurs, decreasing the times the ICD needs to shock the heart. These devices are helping heart failure patients live longer and improving their quality of life. This check is very important because adjustments will be made that can prolong the life of your pacemaker.",When a patient has poor ejection fraction and at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias.,10,Clear and concise explanation of when the therapy is recommended.,When the patient shows signs of arrhythmias and heart failure.,7,"Missing mention of poor ejection fraction, could be more specific."
What happens to my heart if I have heart failure?,"In the normal heart, the heart's lower chambers (ventricles) pump in sync with the heart's upper chambers (atria).

Once the tube is inserted, the doctor can visually inspect the lining of the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus, if it's there, is visible on camera, but the diagnosis requires a biopsy. The doctor will remove a small sample of tissue to be examined under a microscope in the laboratory to confirm a diagnosis. The sample will also be examined for the presence of precancerous cells or cancer. If the biopsy confirms the presence of Barrett's esophagus, your doctor will probably recommend a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy to examine more tissue for early signs of developing cancer.",A gastroenterologist inserts a long flexible tube with a camera down the throat to visually inspect the esophagus and take a biopsy for diagnosis.,10,"Perfect answer, well explained!",A tube with a camera is inserted down the throat to visually inspect the esophagus and take a biopsy.,8,"Good explanation, could mention the sedative given to the patient."

They include: Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) uses radio waves delivered through an endoscope inserted into the esophagus to destroy abnormal cells while protecting the healthy cells underneath. Photodynamic therapy ( PDT) uses a laser through an endoscope to kill abnormal cells in the lining without damaging normal tissue. Before the procedure, the patient takes a drug known as Photofrin, which causes cells to become light-sensitive. Endoscopic spray cryotherapy is a newer technique that applies cold nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas, through the endoscope to freeze the abnormal cells. Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR) lifts the abnormal lining and cuts it off the wall of the esophagus before it's removed through the endoscope. The goal is to remove any precancerous or cancer cells contained in the lining. If cancer cells are present, an ultrasound is done first to be sure the cancer hasn't moved deeper into the esophagus walls. Surgery to remove most of the esophagus is an option in cases where severe precancer (dysplasia) or cancer has been diagnosed. The earlier the surgery is done following the diagnosis, the better the chance for the cure.","Yes, treatments include surgery, radiofrequency ablation, and photodynamic therapy.",10,"Excellent, all key treatments are mentioned.",Some treatments target Barrett's esophagus like proton pump inhibitors.,6,"Good start, but more specific treatments could have been included."

Tapering helps your brain adjust to the chemical changes and can help prevent discontinuation symptoms. Your doctor will tell you how to lower your dose over a couple of days. Never try to do this on your own. Sometimes, doctors can prescribe medicines to help with discontinuation symptoms such as nausea or insomnia.

What should you know about antidepressant discontinuation?,"These symptoms are not technically the same thing as physical ""withdrawal"" from a drug.

Unlike drug withdrawal, antidepressant discontinuation effects are not related to addiction but can reflect physiological consequences of stopping a drug, just as when someone with diabetes stops insulin. About one in five people who take an antidepressant for six or more weeks may experience discontinuation symptoms if they suddenly stop taking the medicine. Tapering down your medication gradually under the supervision of your health care provider can help avoid or minimize symptoms. However, it is still possible in those who decrease their dose too rapidly or sometimes even slowly quit the medicine. However, discontinuation symptoms are more likely with antidepressants that stay in your body for a shorter period of time, especially those that affect both serotonin and norepinephrine, such as Effexor (venlafaxine) and Cymbalta (duloxetine).","Physiological consequences of stopping a drug, not addiction.",10,Correct and comprehensive answer.,Craving and drug-seeking behavior related to addiction.,2,"Incorrect, focus on physiological consequences of stopping the drug."
